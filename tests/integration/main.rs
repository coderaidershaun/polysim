//! Integration suite: real venue, real time, real serialisation — never CI. Every test is `#[ignore]`
//! and agent-run deliberately (`cargo test --test integration -- --ignored`). Grouped as one target
//! so the ignored set runs together, the same way the fitness tests share one target. The bulk run
//! covers read-only checks only; none of these tests places an order.
