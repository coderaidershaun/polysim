//! Chart projection fitness (chunk C1): the pure map from the ordered book and event lanes to the
//! rolling five-minute mid series, and the screen transform over it. Buckets are folded in event time
//! alone, so a spin carrying no trustworthy mid stays a real hole the line splits across rather
//! than an invented sample, and replay reproduces the series exactly. Prices never leave exact
//! half-tick integers until the final `0..=1` fraction. The domain grows left → right before it
//! slides; the bounds cover fills as well as mids, so an off-mid marker can never be invisible.
