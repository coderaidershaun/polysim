//! Chart projection fitness: the pure map from the ordered book and event lanes to the rolling
//! five-minute mid series, and the screen transform over it. A backfill from the engine's memory
//! merges into the mid and position buckets to the same series a continuous feed builds. Buckets
//! are folded in event time alone, so a spin carrying no trustworthy mid stays a real hole the
//! line splits across rather than an invented sample, and replay reproduces the series exactly.
//! Prices never leave exact half-tick integers until the final `0..=1` fraction. The domain grows
//! from left to right before it slides; the bounds cover fills as well as mids, so an off-mid
//! marker can never be invisible.
