//! Zero-allocation fitness for the Kyle's lambda estimator: once the two rolling windows
//! exist, pushing completed bars and refitting the OLS slope over the live window touches the
//! allocator not at all — including across the `#[cold]` copy-back that fires every time the
//! oversized backing fills, which the measured region crosses many times over.
//!
//! A liveness counter rides alongside the allocation assertion: an estimator that quietly gated
//! every call to `None` would satisfy "allocated nothing" perfectly.
