//! Polymarket execution POLICY: the decisions the driver makes that no wire format dictates.
//!
//! Every one of these exists because the venue mints the only order id there is, and mints it in
//! the answer to the placement. That single fact produces a held-frame buffer, an adopt-or-leave
//! rule for orders nobody can name, a cancel that has to wait out the venue's own hold, and a token
//! binding that is only tradeable once three separate reads agree. Socket behaviour stays out;
//! what is pinned here is what the driver DECIDES.
