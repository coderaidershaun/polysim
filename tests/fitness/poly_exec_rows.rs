//! FITNESS: what the Polymarket preflight stamps on a row is what every execution gate downstream
//! believes about the venue, and an unstamped field is not a missing number — it is a gate that
//! silently passes.
//!
//! The four stamps here each close one of those. A `min_qty` of zero admits an order below the
//! venue's floor. A `max_num_orders` of zero sizes the edge's order mirror at nothing, and the FIRST
//! placement of the run dies on it. An absent amend budget lets the reconciler try to shrink an
//! order on a venue with no amend endpoint at all. An absent price ceiling lets an aggressive price
//! walk past parity on a market whose prices ARE probabilities.
//!
//! `scale_preflight` pins the tick and the step this same pass writes; the split is deliberate —
//! that file is about parsing a venue's grid, this one is about arming execution against it.
