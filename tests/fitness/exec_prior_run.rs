//! FITNESS: an order an EARLIER run of this trading engine left resting is still this account's
//! money, and every execution on it lands in the ledger exactly once with the rows that explain it.
//!
//! A run dies with a post-only quote on the book. The next boot cancels it, but the cancel takes
//! hundreds of milliseconds to reach the venue and whatever is resting fills in the meantime — and
//! the myTrades repair surfaces such a fill later still, through the same path. Discarding it leaves
//! the position permanently short by the fill with no row in the `orders` or `fills` tables, so
//! every risk gate prices inventory the account does not hold and the tape cannot explain the gap
//! afterwards. A dropped BUY under-counts real exposure, which is the direction that goes on to
//! quote itself deeper in.
//!
//! What such a fill must NOT do is join this run's quoting. A prior-run order takes no slot the
//! reconciler counts, because the side it rests on is one this run still has to be able to quote —
//! and the second test here is what keeps the two tables apart.
