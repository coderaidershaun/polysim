//! Polymarket execution codec goldens. With no testnet, these run against committed venue payloads
//! are the only place the normalisation layer is exercised before real money moves through it.
//!
//! Four judgements are pinned, because each is silent and expensive when wrong: the fill law (which
//! payload may be folded and which may not), the message-string → [`RejectClass`] table, the split
//! between an order rejection and a venue-wide outage, and the byte-exact place body — whose
//! signature is checked against a vector the official SDK minted, not against our own output.
//!
//! A fifth is here because it was already wrong in the opposite direction: the startup gate's
//! protocol-version read failed loudly against every real venue rather than quietly, and no pin
//! stood between it and a live run.
//!
//! A sixth is the settlement reading, which decides two things money depends on: when a reservation
//! may be released, and whether a failed settlement stops the run. Both are asked long after the
//! order behind the trade stopped being nameable, so both rest on what the payload itself says.
