//! Position-ledger fitness: the engine folds every REAL venue fill into exact per-instrument
//! position, cash and mark-to-market, and hands it back through `ctx`. Three ways this breaks are
//! all silent. Arithmetic that drifts from the fills that produced it yields PnL nobody can audit
//! against the tape. A venue that redelivers a report — and Binance does — would move the money
//! twice, and the second move looks exactly like a real fill. And a mark invented from half a book,
//! or carried across a window rotation into a market whose prices mean something else, values a
//! position at a number no venue ever showed.
//!
//! Every position here opens through the real inbound path ([`FillPen`]), because there is no other
//! one: `SimFill` and `ctx.emit_fill` are gone, and a strategy can no longer assert a fill into
//! existence. The fold therefore lands on the fill's OWN message, ahead of the `on_fill` that
//! reports it — the boundary this file used to state as a drain boundary, restated where it now is.
