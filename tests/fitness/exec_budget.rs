//! FITNESS: the venue's placement budget is spent by the engine's own count, not discovered by
//! being refused.
//!
//! A venue that grants an account so many order placements per window stops accepting them when the
//! grant is gone, and it stops accepting the NEXT one — which may be the marketable order that
//! closes a position. The engine therefore meters what it places and stops quoting first, so the
//! headroom that is left belongs to the way out. That ordering is the whole point of the gate, and
//! the flatten case at the bottom is the one that would cost money if it inverted.
//!
//! Every number here comes from message stamps: the meter advances on the spin tick and counts the
//! placements the spin minted, so a replayed tape refuses at exactly the same point. The last case
//! drives the same sequence twice and pins that.
