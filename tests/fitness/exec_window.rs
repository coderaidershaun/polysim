//! FITNESS: on a venue whose markets EXPIRE, an order must never be resting when one does.
//!
//! Every other gate in the engine protects against a price or a size. This one protects against a
//! clock, and it is the only gate whose failure cannot be traded out of afterwards: a fill taken in
//! the last moment of a five-minute market leaves a position on contracts that settle at nothing or
//! at everything, with no book left to place an order into. The strategy is expected to withdraw
//! first; this is what holds when it does not.
//!
//! Both halves are pinned, and the second is why the first is not enough. Refusing new declarations
//! stops the ladder GROWING, and the reconciler then withdraws what is already there — one order per
//! side per spin, so a full ladder comes down over eight of them. The sweep takes the whole thing in
//! one pass.
//!
//! The gate is driven entirely by message stamps: the window comes from a `MarketRotation` and the
//! instant from the spin tick, so a replay refuses and sweeps at exactly the same points.
