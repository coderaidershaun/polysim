//! FITNESS: the audit trail's banking rule — a row whenever the state OR the filled totals moved,
//! and nothing at all otherwise.
//!
//! Two failures hide in that one sentence. Keying only on STATE loses the order-level counterpart of
//! every partial fill, because a partial fill leaves an order `Live`; the `fills` table then holds
//! line items whose order the `orders` table cannot explain, which is exactly the shape a
//! reconciliation against a venue statement is trying to resolve. Keying on NEITHER — banking every
//! event — fills the table with rows saying nothing changed, and a redelivered report then reads as a
//! second fill in a table whose whole job is to be the durable record of what happened once.
//!
//! `persist_exec.rs` pins the round trip these rows take to Parquet. This pins which rows exist.
