//! FITNESS: the reconciler is where a strategy's wish becomes an order, so every property that
//! decides whether we quote, at what price and at what size is pinned here.
//!
//! It is a pure function, which is the whole reason these can be properties rather than scenarios:
//! no engine, no clock, no ring. The one that matters most is passive snapping, because a bid
//! snapped UP is not a wrong number on a chart, it is an order that crosses the spread and pays the
//! taker fee.
//!
//! The single-flight rule is NOT here. It is side-wide and the engine holds it, so it is pinned
//! where it lives — `exec_ladder`'s `ladder_serialises_and_requotes_only_after_terminal_confirmation`
//! drives a real engine and asserts no replacement goes out beside an unconfirmed cancel.
//!
//! The amend cases at the bottom reach across into the transition table, which nothing else here
//! does. They have to: a shrink CONVERGES only if the venue's answer lands the new size on the slot
//! that the next decision is taken against, so the property spans the fold and the decision and
//! belongs to neither alone.
