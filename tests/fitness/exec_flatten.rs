//! FITNESS: ctx.flatten is the only liquidity-taking path. All safeguards against overuse
//! are tested here. Flatten is a DECLARATION (level-triggered like quotes), not a command:
//! market orders outliving intent should not exist. The engine plans a new order each spin
//! based on current position. The flatten lane is separate from ctx.quote by design: a quote
//! declared Immediate still gets refused by exec_reconcile (a bug where the strategy meant
//! REST but crossed the spread). Both halves are pinned together to prevent convergence on
//! the easiest path.
