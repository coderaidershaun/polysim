//! Booting with a position you already hold. The ledger became cross-session when exposure started
//! surviving restarts, and that created a trap no test starting flat can reach.
//!
//! A restored long boots with `position_base` positive, `cash_quote` at MINUS its cost basis, and
//! `mark: None` — every part of that legitimate, because the load path restores cost basis and a
//! mark is not honest until a two-sided book has produced one. But `pnl_quote()` is `cash +
//! exposure`, and with no mark exposure is zero, so **raw PnL at boot reads as the entire cost basis
//! being lost**. A session loss limit compared against that halts a perfectly healthy engine before
//! it places an order, and does it on every restart that carries inventory — looking exactly like a
//! risk control working correctly.
//!
//! The gate avoids it by taking each instrument's baseline at its FIRST MARK rather than at
//! construction, so the figure it measures is a mark-to-market delta and the restored cost basis
//! cancels. These are the pins for that, and they need a seeded ledger, which is why they live here
//! beside the restore rather than in `risk_gate.rs`.
//!
//! The second test is the counterweight: the baseline must not be so generous that the limit stops
//! working. A baseline captured at CONSTRUCTION would also let the engine quote — while silently
//! carrying the whole restored position's cost as headroom, so no session loss could ever trip it.
//!
//! The last two are the other end of the same promise. Restoring a position is worth nothing unless
//! the run that takes fills WRITES one, so they drive the whole path — engine, snapshot, ring, writer
//! thread, file — and pin that the final snapshot survives the sink's owner going away.
