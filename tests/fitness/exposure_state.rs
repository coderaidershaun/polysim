//! A position outlives the process that opened it. This file pins the three ways that promise
//! breaks — and the third is the one that would cost real money silently.
//!
//!  1. The file stops being readable. Every write goes through a temporary sibling and a rename, so
//!     a process killed mid-write leaves a whole document behind, never a prefix of one.
//!  2. The file stops being trustworthy. Another engine's identity, another format version, another
//!     fixed-point scale, or a live position in an instrument this config no longer names all mean
//!     the numbers say something other than what they appear to. Each refuses the boot: trading
//!     against a position that cannot be read is worse than not trading.
//!  3. **The engine overwrites its own past.** A writer that starts believing the disk is empty puts
//!     an empty document over a real position the instant anything triggers a write — before the
//!     engine has folded a single message. Nothing downstream can detect it, because the file that
//!     would have proved it is the file that was destroyed.
//!
//! What is durable is the COST BASIS, never the derived exposure: `mark` is deliberately absent
//! until the first two-sided book, so a restored valuation would be a number with nothing behind it.
//! The file carries a last-known exposure for a human, and these tests pin that the load path
//! ignores it.
