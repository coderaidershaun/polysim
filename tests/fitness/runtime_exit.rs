//! Shutdown exit-status truth table: a fatal trip — the trigger OR one that occurs while the
//! queues drain (a hot-thread panic caught by the panic hook) — must never be reported as a
//! graceful (exit-0) shutdown, and a fatal dominates a drain error. `decide_exit` is the pure
//! decision `run_until_shutdown` wires through; one case per row of its truth table. An external
//! graceful trigger flows through the same path as a signal (reason "shutdown request"), and
//! [`ShutdownRequest`] is the latch it trips.
