//! The two-way control path, and the two bugs it is shaped around.
//!
//! Hot state is a pure function of the ordered input sequence, so the run state a strategy
//! is gated on must come from a RECORDED marker and never from the atomic the link actor latches —
//! an atomic set off-thread makes suppression depend on ITS timing, and replay diverges.
//!
//! The marker's input queue drops and counts rather than failing, because its producer is a remote
//! peer and a peer that can flood the port must not be able to kill the engine. So control
//! is LEVEL-triggered: the actor asks what marker is still outstanding rather than reacting to a
//! transition, and a dropped slot costs one heartbeat instead of leaving the edge parked and the hot
//! thread trading forever.
