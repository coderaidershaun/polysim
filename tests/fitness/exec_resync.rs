//! Resync fitness: the post-subscribe pass must CONVERGE, and must TELL the hot side that it did.
//!
//! It is the gate between a fresh connection and quoting, and a pass that stalls is silent — the
//! actor keeps its socket, its stream and its heartbeat, and simply drops every order the strategy
//! asks for until the venue drops the connection 23 hours later. The first property forbids that: a
//! pass still waiting on a read always has something outstanding or something scheduled.
//!
//! The second half is the other way the same silence was reached. The pass converged perfectly and
//! told nobody, so the hot side's readiness gate — which arms on the pass's end marker and on
//! nothing else — could never arm on a cold start, and an armed engine placed nothing for the life
//! of the process with no diagnostic at all. Green tests did not notice because every one of them
//! synthesised the marker by hand. So these drive the real constructor, and the last of them pins
//! the diagnostic that would have made the original bug a one-minute read.
