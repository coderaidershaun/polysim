//! The polymarket publisher trading engine: one frame per spin carrying both up legs, each written
//! into the block named for the ROLE it plays — `cur` hosts the open window, `next` the one not yet
//! open.
//!
//! Worth pinning because every way of getting it wrong is SILENT. Window N's close IS window N+1's
//! open, so an inclusive comparison puts two legs in the current block for one microsecond; a `>`
//! instead of `>=` keeps publishing through the post-close resolution tail, where the market is only
//! settling to 0 or 1. A block written at the wrong offset mislabels a column that still looks live.
//! And the volume fields' cumulative reading is law rather than taste, because link frames may be
//! dropped: a per-spin delta would lose a spin permanently on the first dropped frame.
//!
//! The second half of the file is the same engine's MAKER, driven against the real execution engine
//! rather than the link, and it is here rather than in a file of its own because the two halves
//! share a calendar: which leg is `cur` on the wire is the same question as which leg may be quoted,
//! and a change to the role rule that this file caught on one side and not the other would be a
//! strategy publishing one market while trading another.
