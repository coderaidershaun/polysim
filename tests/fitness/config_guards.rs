//! Config/registry venue-generalisation shape: one trading engine carries exactly one source, and
//! that source's fan-out to instruments, producer groups and input queues is asserted through the
//! real `from_yaml`/`build` path — one binance source is three connections onto one instrument, one
//! polymarket source is one connection onto the four fixed A/B-by-up/down slots. The shipped
//! reference config is asserted here too, since `deny_unknown_fields` makes it brittle to any
//! schema change.
