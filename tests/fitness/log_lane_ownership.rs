//! `log::register_thread` scopes a log lane to the calling OS THREAD, and no Rust signature can
//! stop a tokio task body from calling it. Eight of them once did: tasks share the multi-worker
//! pool, so two landing on one worker overwrote each other's tag and a task migrating at an
//! `.await` pushed into whichever ring that worker had last registered — a Binance REST warning
//! could be filed under `[polymarket-exec]`. One log file carries engine and strategy records
//! alike, and the tag column is the only thing distinguishing their origin, so the attribution is
//! load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
//!
//! The rule is invisible at the call site, so the threads are named here one at a time. A new call
//! site fails until someone states which OS thread it owns, and a task author is pointed at
//! `log::tag_task` instead.
