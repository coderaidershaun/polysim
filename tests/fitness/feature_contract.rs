//! The two published contracts of the recorder, frozen against a copy no refactor can reach.
//!
//! `FeatureId` is a position in `FEATURE_NAMES`, so the list IS the Parquet footer dictionary: a
//! reordering renames every column of every file already on disk while the engine, the pins and the
//! UI catalog all stay green, because they read the same list they wrote. The list's 57..77 block
//! is the link schema, whose digest gates every frame — a drift there is drop + count SILENT: the
//! receiver rejects the lot as `SchemaMismatch` and the engine keeps running.
//!
//! So the expectations here are hand-copied literals, never derived from the source of truth. That
//! duplication is the entire mechanism; a "cleanup" that reads the constant back proves nothing.
