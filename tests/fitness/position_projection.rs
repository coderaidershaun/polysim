//! Risk-chart projection fitness: the map from the ordered event lane to the rolling exposure/PnL
//! series, and the quote-unit window over it. The lower chart is stacked ON the mid chart and reads
//! under one shared crosshair, so its failure mode is not a crash but a value shown against the wrong
//! spin — or an axis whose labels imply a position nobody holds. Three properties carry that weight:
//! both series bucket one event time identically, the window is never derived here, and a wire value
//! becomes the exact quote mantissa the engine's ledger held.
