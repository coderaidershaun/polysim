//! FITNESS: the session loss budget is a KILL SWITCH, and what decides whether it halts is whether
//! the loss has been REALISED — never whether the position happens to be exactly flat.
//!
//! The two verdicts differ because only one of them can still come back. A loss still marked to
//! market may be recovered by the position moving, so the engine withdraws the side that would ADD
//! to it and keeps the reducing side quoting: withdrawing both is a deadlock, since the only thing
//! that unwinds a position is a fill and the only thing that produces a fill is a quote
//! (`risk_gate.rs` is that property's own file). A loss booked into closed round trips and paid fees
//! is gone, and no price can hand it back — so it halts.
//!
//! Reading "realised" off an exactly-zero position is what this file exists to stop. One satoshi of
//! residue — the ordinary state after any partial fill — turned the kill switch into a permanent
//! side restriction, and losses then kept growing on the side that was still admitted.
