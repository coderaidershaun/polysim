//! Fitness suite: the only CI tests. Proptest properties over recorded invariants, plus a
//! counting global allocator so the zero-allocation guarantees can be asserted rather than
//! trusted. Grouped as one test target so plain `cargo test` runs every area.
//!
//! Every module on disk is declared here. A suite that compiles but is not listed runs nowhere, so
//! absence from this file is the one way coverage can be lost without a diff showing it.
