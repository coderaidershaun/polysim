//! The latency panel's number writers. A grouped reading is the only thing the operator has to
//! judge engine health by, and its failure mode is silent: a separator placed one digit off turns
//! 3.4 seconds into 345 milliseconds, which reads as a perfectly healthy engine rather than as a
//! broken renderer. The panel also threads ONE scratch buffer through every cell it paints, so each
//! test reuses a single buffer — a writer that appended instead of clearing would fail these pins
//! the same way it would corrupt the grid.
