//! Link schema both trading engines must agree on. #[path]-included from both strategy.rs.
//! The LINK_FIELDS digest is the schema_hash carried on every frame, so any drift between the two
//! sides makes the receiver reject every frame.
//!
//! Absent = `f64::NAN` — no book side, book not yet Valid, no or stale (A, k) fit, unfilled role.
//! The receiver emits only finite slots, and NaN survives the codec bit-exactly.
//!
//! Volumes are CUMULATIVE traded qty since that leg's rotation, in outcome shares, zeroed at
//! rotation. Link topics must carry STATE rather than deltas, because a frame may be dropped: a
//! dropped delta would lose its spin's volume forever, whereas a dropped cumulative frame is
//! superseded by the next. Per-spin volume differences out offline, and a decrease marks a rotation.
//!
//! `_bid`/`_ask` on the intensity fields follow the engine's convention — a sell aggressor hits the
//! bid, so bid intensity is fitted from sells.
