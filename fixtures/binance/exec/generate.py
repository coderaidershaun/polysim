"""Regenerates every fixture in this directory.

It exists because the client order id format is a decision that will move at least once, and the ids
are embedded in 30 files across four different payload shapes. Editing them by hand guarantees that
some subset drifts — and the ones most likely to be missed are the hand-written edge cases, which
are exactly the ones that matter.

It is Python, and porting it to Rust would gut the suite: these fixtures test our DECODER, so a
generator built on our own wire types would only prove our decoder agrees with our encoder. The
question is whether it agrees with Binance. No Rust type flows in here, and that is deliberate.

To change the id format, change `client_order_id` below and re-run. Nothing else knows the format.
