//! Maps a venue error onto a reject class. This venue names no numeric codes, so
//! classification matches on HTTP status and message prefix instead.
//!
//! An unrecognised 4xx is Fatal, because retrying an error we cannot name would flood duplicate
//! orders. An unrecognised 5xx is Ambiguous, because the gateway may have accepted the order even
//! though the response failed.
//!
//! HTTP 425/429/503 are venue states, not order rejects. They leave as VenueAvailability and never
//! hit the hot path, so they never feed the reject streak or park the engine during outages.
