//! What only this venue can answer: core decides, driver applies. The connect, serve and back-off
//! loop around it belongs to the shared edge chassis. The transport model is unique: no request
//! socket exists. All placements, cancels, and reads use HTTP across three lanes ([`rest`]). The
//! user stream receives events only and never replays after disconnect — reconnects trigger a full
//! state re-read. Polymarket mints the order id in the placement answer, making correlation
//! straightforward.
