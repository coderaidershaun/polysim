//! The venue's request half. Polymarket has no request socket: placements, cancels and reads are
//! all HTTP, and the user stream only listens.
//!
//! Three lanes, not one. A marketable order is held 250 ms at the venue and `POST /order` BLOCKS for
//! that hold, so a cancel queued behind a place would inherit a delay the venue imposed on somebody
//! else's risk; the two buckets are metered separately at the venue too. The heartbeat gets the
//! third lane because going quiet for ten seconds cancels the whole book — it must not queue behind
//! a read that is waiting out a timeout.
//!
//! L2 headers are signed HERE rather than at the call site: the timestamp they carry is the send
//! stamp, and this is the last moment before the bytes leave.
