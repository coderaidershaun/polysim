//! The user stream. Unsolicited, account-wide, and it replays nothing after a disconnect.
//!
//! A frame naming an order this run cannot map is the venue's normal behaviour here, not a fault:
//! the placement answer that mints the mapping may still be in flight. Such a frame is HELD and
//! re-read when a mapping lands. Only a frame still unattributable after the hold is a problem, and
//! then it is loud — it describes a fill the ledger has not seen.
