//! The session chassis every venue edge runs on: dial, serve, back off, sweep, stop. A venue brings
//! its own select! loop and its own idea of what can be sent while the socket is down; the ordering
//! rules — which latch wins, how long blind before resting orders are pulled, when the settled
//! signal is raised — live here once. Two copies of a safety rule drift, and the cost of the drift
//! is an order left resting with nothing watching it.
//!
//! It sits beside the venue-neutral execution machinery rather than inside it. That machinery is
//! scanned for clock reads, because hot state has to replay identically from a recorded tape,
//! whereas this file cannot do its job without reading one: pacing a reconnect and measuring how
//! long an edge has been blind are both wall-clock questions.
