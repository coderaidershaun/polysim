//! The one bounded ring behind every rolling series the desktop shows: the monitor's four channel
//! histories, the chart's per-instrument bucket ring and its fill ring. One eviction policy shared by
//! all of them, so no panel invents its own retention rule.

/// A fixed-capacity ring of the freshest `capacity` items: pushes past capacity silently evict the
/// oldest, iteration runs from either end, and `appended` counts every push ever so a viewer derives
/// an unseen count from a stored watermark. The backing store is reserved once at construction —
/// steady state never reallocates.
