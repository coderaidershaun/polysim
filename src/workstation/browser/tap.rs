//! The one rule that pins a readout by touch, shared by the ladder, the monitor and the chart.
//!
//! Only a finger's tap makes a pin, because a mouse already shows every readout on hover. A tap on
//! something pinnable pins it. While a pin is set, a finger tap on another pinnable thing in the
//! same pane moves it there. A second tap on the same thing, a tap on nothing pinnable, or any
//! mouse click in the pane lets go. A click or tap in another pane, or on a popup or window that
//! something else draws over the pane, leaves the pin alone.
