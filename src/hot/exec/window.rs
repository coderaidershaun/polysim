//! Execution windows for markets that expire. This module handles three aspects: when a window admits
//! quotes, what happens to resting orders as the window closes, and how rotation into the next market
//! affects accounting. All three relate to the same fundamental fact: each instrument slot points to
//! a market that rotates periodically. Instruments without rotation (like Binance) are unaffected.
//! Every deadline derives from message timestamps, so replays close and rotate at exact sequence points.
