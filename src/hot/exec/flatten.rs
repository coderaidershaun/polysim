//! The flatten planner translates position (what is held) into a single marketable order that closes
//! it. Purely functional: takes position and market state, returns an order or a reason to refuse.
//!
//! Separate from the quote reconciler because it answers a different question. The reconciler asks
//! what the book should look like; flatten asks how to stop holding a position. Both are pure:
//! fitness can run them without an engine, and a strategy uses this path only when trying to exit.
//!
//! Idempotent by design: the strategy re-declares intent every spin, the plan sizes to current
//! position, and partial fills produce a smaller order next spin. Nothing remembers what was sent.
//! The engine-side pass is at file bottom, colocated with the planner, so their decisions stay aligned.
